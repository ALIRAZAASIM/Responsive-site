Responsive Website ⬇️
To build responsive websites for mobile devices and other screens, keep these tips in mind: ⏬

1️⃣ Use viewport units (vh, vw) instead of pixels (px) to enhance responsiveness across various devices. 📏

2️⃣ Make sure images can resize easily so they fit well on the screen without getting cut off. 🖼️

3️⃣ Utilize media queries, such as @media (max-width: 600px) {}, to apply specific styles for different screen sizes. 📱

4️⃣ Optimize design for smaller screens, making it adaptable for both small and large displays. 📊

5️⃣ Ensure buttons and links are of an appropriate size for easy interaction. 🔗

6️⃣ Continuously test responsiveness using tools like browser developer tools and viewport simulations. 🔍
